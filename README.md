# Notify Me

Notify Me is a project that allows users to receive notifications when there is a deposit or withdrawal of ERC20 tokens in their wallet on the Ethereum mainnet. The project is built using Node.js, React.js, Alchemy and push SDK.

## Getting Started

To start using Notify Me, head over to our application at https://srv-smn.github.io/Push-Santa-Contest-Frontend/ and connect your wallet to the Goerli Testnet. Once connected, click on subscribe and it will opt you in to the push notification channel. You will then start receiving notifications whenever there is a deposit or withdrawal in your wallet for ERC20 tokens.

## How Notify Me Can Help You

1. Notify Me allows you to stay informed about deposits and withdrawals in your wallet.
2. By receiving all notifications, you may be able to identify any unauthorized withdrawals and take 3. action to secure your remaining funds if necessary.
Our service is free to use.

## Notification Details

Notifications will show you the amount credited/debited, the current balance for that ERC20 token, and a picture of the token. If you click on the notification, you will be redirected to the portfolio section of etherescan, where you can view your complete portfolio.

### Please note that:

1. Notify Me supports almost all popular ERC20 tokens.
2. It currently only supports the mainnet.
3. You may not receive real-time notifications as we are using a cron in the backend that runs at specific intervals.
